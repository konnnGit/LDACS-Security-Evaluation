In order to produce experimental data there are three python files explained as follows:

A:The first benchmarks KEMs and AES-256-CBC execution time,

B:The second executes reverse engineering ML attack against PUF, providing prediction results for the challenge. 

C:The third one quantifies  the entropy of ciphetexts generated by AES-256-GCM session key. That key produced from the  several PQC KEMs. 

Scripts'  results  have been executed  by an i3 processor.
